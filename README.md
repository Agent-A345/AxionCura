## 🧠 AxionCura – Early Stroke Prediction System

An AI-powered stroke risk prediction system built using Python and Machine Learning. The model analyzes patient health parameters to predict the likelihood of stroke and support early preventive action.

## 🚀 Features
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
2. **Machine Learning Model** – Trained classification model for stroke prediction.
3. **Pipeline Integration** – End-to-end preprocessing + model bundled using joblib.
4. **Model Serialization** – Saved trained model for direct inference.
5. **Prediction System** – Accepts patient input and outputs stroke risk prediction.
